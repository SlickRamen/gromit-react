# Gromit
A lightweight iconfont editor for web applications


## About
Gromit is an open source tool used to locally create groups of icons and export them to icon fonts easily. It is currently very early on in development, but I plan to update in the future.

## How to run
Currently the frontend is running as a React app with a Node server for backend functionality. To run the react app simply enter `npm start` into the terminal. This will start the app on port 3000.
To run the backend, enter `node src/server.js` into the terminal.
