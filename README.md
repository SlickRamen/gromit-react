# Gromit
A lightweight iconfont editor for web applications


## About
I am currently developing this as an open source tool that allows me to locally create icon fonts easily. It is currently very early on in development but I plan to update it in the near future.

## How to run
Currently the frontend is running as a React app and there is a Node server for backend functionality. To run the react app simply enter `npm start` into the terminal. This will start the app on port 3000.
To run the backend, enter `node src/server.js` into the terminal.
